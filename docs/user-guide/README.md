## Key Concepts

### Clusters
Kubernetes clusters are the primary resources managed by KubeNexus. Each cluster represents a separate Kubernetes environment that you can monitor, manage, and access through the platform.

### Users and Roles
KubeNexus implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have appropriate permissions. The system includes predefined roles and supports custom role creation.

### SRE Agent
The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) agent is KubeNexus's AI-powered component that continuously monitors your clusters, detects anomalies, and provides intelligent recommendations for optimization and problem resolution.

### Monitoring and Metrics
KubeNexus collects comprehensive metrics from your clusters and provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and performance analysis capabilities.

## User Interface Overview

### Navigation
The KubeNexus interface is organized into main sections:

- **Dashboard**: Overview of all clusters and system health
- **Clusters**: Cluster management and operations
- **Monitoring**: Metrics, alerts, and performance dashboards
- **SRE**: AI-powered insights and recommendations
- **Terminal**: Web-based kubectl access
- **Users**: User and role management (admin only)
- **Audit**: Audit logs and compliance tracking

### Dashboard Features
- Cluster status overview
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Recent alerts and events
- Quick access to common operations

## Common Workflows

### Daily Operations

2. Review any new alerts or recommendations
3. Monitor resource utilization
4. Handle any required maintenance tasks

### Troubleshooting
1. Identify issues through monitoring dashboards
2. Use SRE agent insights for analysis
3. Access clusters via web terminal for investigation
4. Apply recommended fixes or escalate as needed

### Maintenance
1. Review SRE recommendations regularly
2. Plan and execute cluster updates
3. Monitor performance after changes
4. Document lessons learned

## Advanced Features

### API Integration
